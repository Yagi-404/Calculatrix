## What is Calculatrix ?

Calculatrix is a project where I'll create plenty of calculators in a lot of differents languages.
I know this sounds stupid but if you want to waste your time and contribute, you can...

## List of currents languages

- Python
- Java

More languages will be aivilable soon 👀.

## Installation

### - Python 🐍

#### Depedencies

- Python 3 or >
- [Pyinstaller](https://pypi.org/project/pyinstaller/) is optional
- Git

After you're done with installations, open a new terminal session and type:

```sh
# this clone the repo
# and go to the repo folder

$ git clone https://github.com/Yagi-404/Calculatrix
$ cd \Calculatrix\python\
```

#### Native Python

For native Python (no modules), you can type:
```sh
$ python <file to execute>.py
```

Type `Crtl` + `C` to stop the program.

#### Pyinstaller

*Pyinstaller* is a Python module that allows you to compile Python code into an .exe file.
This is an extra feature if you want to increase the execution speed.
To install Pyinstaller, you need :

- Python 3.6 .. 3.10
- PIP (it's better to have the latest version)
- Windows 8 or + (32/64 bits) 
OR
MacOS X (32/64 bits)
OR
Any version of GNU/Linux

Now, type in a terminal:
```sh
# install the module

$ pip install pyinstaller

# compile

$ pyinstaller ./path/to-your/file_to_compile.py
```
This should make a lot of new folders.

You should fine compiled files on dist/ and __ pycache __/ directories.

<!-- ### Java

#### Dependecies

- Java JRE 8 or >
- Git

After you're done with installations, open a new terminal session
and type :

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Yagi-404/Calculatrix
$ cd .\Calculatrix\java
```

#### Execution
